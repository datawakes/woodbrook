In Woodbrook the annual dues are collected in order to cover the association's annual operating expenses.  These expenses include but are not limited to: road snow removal, street tree maintenance (trimming, removal, plantings), additional NCC police patrols, common area maintenance, etc.  In a typical year, these expenses can exceed $50,000.  Just as our contractors do not voluntarily supply their services, our association dues are not voluntary.  When one neighbor chooses not to pay their dues, another neighbor takes on an additional burden.  The board asks that you do the right thing for your neighbors and the community as a whole and keep your account up to date.  If you are suffering from financial hardship or just have a question about dues or the association finances, feel free to contact our Treasurer at Finance@WoodbrookDelaware.org

Woodbrook annual dues are $200 per household.  Checks should be made out to Woodbrook Civic Association and mailed to Vicky Sullivan at 314 Waycross Rd.
