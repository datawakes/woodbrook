As we reported in January, [New Castle County Police][policehtml] made several arrests in connection with the rash of burglaries in [Woodbrook](/) and the surrounding neighborhoods late last year.

However, we must remain vigilant!  Since the arrests, there was a mid-afternoon break-in on Foulkstone Road, several cars broken into on Foulkstone and a car vandalized on Kerfoot Farm Road.  

### Safety Reminders

* **PLEASE** lock your cars, doors and windows at all times!
* **PLEASE** do not leave valuables in your car! 
* **PLEASE** leave all exterior lights on during the night! 
* If you see something suspicious, **PLEASE** call 911 immediately. 
 
In order to notify residents of an incident as quickly as possible, the Board of Directors has established a protocol.  If your home or car is broken into, please contact your Block Representative so that he or she may contact the Board of Directors, who will send an email alert to all residents.  We will not disclose your name, just the street and nature of the incident.  Please read below for details on the Block Representative program.
 
Finally, as Spring arrives, our neighborhood children will be outside playing and riding bikes.  PLEASE drive slowly and be on the lookout for kids on bikes and on the sidewalks as you back out of your driveway!
