As a reminder, property owners are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the sidewalks on their property.  The Board of Directors urges residents to keep their sidewalks in good repair to prevent injuries and any resulting legal actions.
 
At the Annual Meeting in February, the Board of Directors introduced the idea of the Homeownersâ€™ Association taking responsibility for repairing sidewalks that have been damaged by street trees.  This added responsibility would result in a significant increase in dues, possibly by as much as 50 percent.  After brief discussion, a show of hands by the residents at the meeting indicated nearly unanimous support for the idea.  The Board of Directors will research the idea further and consider it for next year.
